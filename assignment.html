        <h2>Using python send an email</h2>
        <p>To check and reply to the emails is a big-time draining. Obviously, you cannot write a program to handle all your emails because each email requires its own response. But if you know how to write programs that can send and receive emails, you can also automate loads of email-related activities.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, you might have a spreadsheet having details of customer records and you want to send each customer a personalized message. Commercial software might be able to do this for you but it will charge you more. In such cases, you can write your own program to send these personalized emails, saving yourself a lot of time copying and pasting form emails.
        </p>   
        <p> 
        Several computer programs can even notify you of things when you are away from your computer. You don't want to return to your machine every few minutes to check the state of the program while you're automating a process that takes a couple of hours to complete. Instead, when it's finished, the software will only text your number, allowing you to work on more meaningful items while you are away from your device. Isnâ€™t it a good deal?

        <h3>SMTP in Python Email</h3>
        <p>SMTP determines how to format, encrypt and send email messages between mail servers, and all the other information that your system manages after you have pressed Send. However, you do not need to know this technical information, since the smtplib module from Python simplifies them into a few functions. </p>
        <p>SMTP works with only sending emails to everyone. A separate protocol, called IMAP, deals with email retrieval sent to you and is defined in IMAP.</p>
